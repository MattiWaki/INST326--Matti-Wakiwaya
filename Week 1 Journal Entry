Week 1 - I used AI just a little bit this week on the exercises but that was it. I had a couple questions about some concepts that were used in our exercises. I remember using all of them before but I forgot the differences between some like .strip() and .split() and I just needed other reminders and explanations about some other concepts and keywords I forgot, like .replace() and abs and fstrings. So I just used AI to give me brief descriptions to remind me what these things are and how they work so that I could continue on with the exercises at a good pace.
