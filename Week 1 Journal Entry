Week 1 - I used AI just a little bit this week on the exercises but that was it. I had a couple questions about some concepts that were used in our exercises. I remember using all of them before but I forgot the differences between some like .strip() and .split() and I just needed other reminders and explanations about some other concepts and keywords I forgot, like .replace() and abs and fstrings. So I just used AI to give me brief descriptions to remind me what these things are and how they work so that I could continue on with the exercises at a good pace. And here is my chat link: https://chatgpt.com/share/68c761d9-4074-8013-b6ba-bab2046bfa40
Week 2 - I used AI again this week while doing some of the exercises. I'm learning a lot of new keywords like pop() and some other stuff so I just asked chat to explain what pop() does and then I was able to do the exercise for that one. I also had to ask it to remind me how slicing works because I know I used it before but I forgot the order of how it works but now I know it is start:stop:step and I was able to do that question too. But that is pretty much all I used AI for this week.
